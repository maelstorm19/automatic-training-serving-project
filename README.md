# automatic-training-serving-project
This repository is a project to automatically train and serve a classifier model

## part1. Introduction

## part2. Project Structure
- base :  Contains the base classes for building and training models
- dataset_repository :  Contains the raw training images
- datasetManager :  A custom module to deal with the dataset and applying some ETL before training
- logs : Training process logs are stored there
- model_architecture/architecture.py :
        This module contains classes which are the names of the model you want to build.
        All the classes should implement the method build_model from the base class.

model_repository: Contains the .h5 model after the training

- export_keras_to_pb.py : A script to export the keras model to the SavedModel format
- make_inference.py: A script to test the newly created model on your images and test the seerving endpoint

- run_training : A script to train the model
- serving: Contains the different versions of the exported SavedModel models
- tfRecords_datasets : Contains the generated train, test, val sets in the .tfrecords format


## part3. Project prerequisites

To avoid problems caused by different os(Mac, PC) and dependencies, I mounted a docker images to run the project.

So make sure you have docker installed on your machine.


## part4. Quick start

- Clone this repository : git clone https://github.com/maelstorm19/automatic-training-serving-project.git
- Go to the the cloned repository and run :  mkdir dataset_repository
- Download the cat vs dog training(train and test1 files images on kaggle :  https://www.kaggle.com/ruchibahl18/cats-vs-dogs-basic-cnn-tutorial
- Unzip the downloaded files into the dataset_repository directory(both train and test1 directory shoulld be there)
- Move to the same directory as the Dockerfile and build the image : docker build -t cat-vs-dog-train-serv .
- Launch the docker image with port 9000 open : docker run -it -t -p 9000:9000 cat-vs-dog-train-serv /bin/bash
- inside the docker image, you can :

    - train a model by running the command :  python run_training.py -lr={'Your learning rate'}, batch_size={'Your batch_size'}
    - serve a model by running the command : tensorflow_model_server --model_base_path=/serving_app/serving/saved_model --rest_api_port=9000 --model_name=cat-dog
    - Test the served model by running the command python make_inference --image={'Your image path'}
